            <p id="question">How long does it take to process an order?</p>
            <p id="answer">
              Order processing typically takes 1-2 business days. During peak
              seasons or promotional events, it may take slightly longer. Rest
              assured, we work diligently to get your order ready for shipment
              as quickly as possible.

            <p id="question">Can I track my order's shipment?</p>
            <p id="answer">
              Absolutely! Once your order is shipped, you will receive a
              shipping confirmation email containing a tracking link. You can
              use this link to monitor the progress of your package until it
              reaches your doorstep.

          <li class="qanda">
            <p id="question">How long does shipping take?</p>
            <p id="answer">
              Shipping times depend on your location and the shipping method
              selected during checkout. In general, domestic orders will arrive
              within 3-7 business days, while international orders may take 7-21
              business days to arrive.

              What should I do if my package is lost or damaged during transit?
            </p>
            <p id="answer">
              If your package is lost or damaged during transit, please contact
              our customer support immediately. We will work with the shipping
              carrier to resolve the issue and ensure you receive a replacement
              or a refund, as applicable.

              What happens if I'm not at home when my package is delivered?
            </p>
            <p id="answer">
              If you're not available at the time of delivery, the shipping
              carrier will typically leave a delivery notification or attempt
              delivery on another day. You may also be able to arrange a pickup
              from a local courier center depending on the carrier's policies.
